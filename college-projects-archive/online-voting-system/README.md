This project is my first project in ASP.NET using WebForms.
Through this project, I learnt the following :

  1. About developing data-driven web applications in ASP.NET

  3. Deploying through GitHub on Azure cloud

This is a simple e-voting system, which provides the automation of the process of voting.

3. Candidate Panel for viewing the profile & a facility for changing the registered organization.
4. Voter Panel in which the user can edit his/her profile (with profile picture & password) & vote for elections.
5. Results are available across the 3 users :- **Organization** , **Candidate** & **Voter**.
