## This App uses the _Deprecated_ JSON API. The New Version with the updated API shall be put soon. Thank you for your patience

In this repo, I have created an android app, which communicates with the URL shortener API (made previously) and generates (& saves the generated)
links in the app (locally). Whenever the user wants to access the link, click on the item & you get access to the link.
